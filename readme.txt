Let's face it, user management in Wordpress doesn't have a lot to offer when it comes to organizing, segmenting, or messaging users. It's not meant to be used as a "user management system" or CRM really. 

With ConveYour for Wordpress, your Wordpress users will automatically be mirrored in ConveYour. You can start taking advantage of ConveYour's contact management & messaging features immediately without manual imports from Wordpress. Your ConveYour contact list will always be up to date. 

- Adds a user to your ConveYour account when a WordPress user signs up!
- Keeps your Wordpress user info up to date in ConveYour
- Tracks when WP users log in

_"Advanced Forms for WordPress Websites Just Don't Get Any Easier than [Gravity Forms](http://www.gravityforms.com/)"_
**Create or update a ConveYour contact through your Gravity Forms.**

Integrating with Gravity Forms is so easy. ConveYour for Wordpress works with all Gravity Forms license levels.

**How does it work?**

On any Gravity form, simply create a hidden field called `conveyour`. This will tell the plugin that you want to send the contents of the Gravity Form to ConveYour as contact submission! 

**Gravity Forms for ConveYour campaign registration**

Use your Gravity Form as a [ConveYour Campaign](http://conveyour.com/help?category=campaigns) registration form! Simply add a hidden field to your Gravity Form called `conveyour_campaign` with the value being the ConveYour campaign ID.
